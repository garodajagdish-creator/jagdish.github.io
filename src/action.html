              <p>Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from operating in America by making it
                illegal to transfer money to them through any US bank or payment system. As a result of this law, most
                of the popular online casino networks such as Party Gaming and PlayTech left the United States.
                Overnight, online casino players found themselves being chased by the Federal government. But, after a
                fortnight, the online casino industry came up with a solution and new online casinos started taking
                root. These began to operate under a different business umbrella, and by doing that, rendered the
                transfer of money to and from them legal. A major part of this was enlisting electronic banking systems
                that would accept this new clarification and start doing business with me. Listed in this article are
                the electronic banking systems that accept players from the United States that wish to play in online
